# Area of Shapes
Welcome to the Area of Shapes project! This C++ application provides a tool for calculating the area of various geometric shapes. The Area of Shapes program allows users to input the dimensions of different shapes and computes their respective areas based on the provided inputs.

## Shapes Supported
1. **Rectangle:** Calculates the area of a rectangle based on its length and width.
   
2. **Square:** Computes the area of a square based on the length of one side.

3. **Circle:** Determines the area of a circle based on its radius.

4. **Triangle:** Computes the area of a triangle based on its base and height.

5. **Trapezoid:** Calculates the area of a trapezoid based on its two bases and height.

## Installation
To run the Area of Shapes program on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/RadinaAvramova/Area-of-Shapes.git

2. **Navigate to the Directory:** Change your current directory to the location of the cloned repository:

cd Area-of-Shapes

3. **Compile and Run:** Compile the C++ source files and run the application using a C++ compiler, such as g++:

g++ main.cpp -o Area-of-Shapes

./Area-of-Shapes

## Usage
1. **Launch the Application:** Run the Area of Shapes program to start calculating areas of different shapes.

2. **Select Shape:** Choose the desired shape for which you want to calculate the area (Rectangle, Square, Circle, Triangle, or Trapezoid).

3. **Enter Dimensions:** Input the required dimensions for the selected shape (e.g., length, width, radius, base, and height).

4. **View Result:** The program will compute the area of the chosen shape based on the provided dimensions and display the result.

5. **Repeat Calculation:** You can repeat the calculation for different shapes by selecting another shape and entering its dimensions.

## Customization
1. **Additional Shapes:** Extend the program to support additional geometric shapes by implementing corresponding area calculation formulas.

2. **Input Validation:** Enhance input validation to handle invalid or out-of-range input values more robustly and provide informative error messages.

3. **Unit Conversion:** Implement unit conversion functionality to allow users to input dimensions in different units (e.g., inches, centimeters) and convert them to a standard unit for calculation.
